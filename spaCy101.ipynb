    "\n",
    "When you start running your own experiments, you might find that a lot of things just don't work the way you want them to. And that's okay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training models is an iterative process, and you have to try different things until you find out what works best.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, I'll be sharing some best practices and things to keep in mind when training your own models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at some of the problems you may come across.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 1: Models cab 'Forget' things**\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical models can learn lots of things – but it doesn't mean that they won't unlearn them.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're updating an existing model with new data, especially new labels, it can overfit and adjust too much to the new examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if you're only updating it with examples of \"website\", it may \"forget\" other labels it previously predicted correctly – like \"person\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also known as the **catastrophic forgetting problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent this, make sure to always mix in examples of what the model previously got correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're training a new category \"website\", also include examples of \"person\".\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy can help you with this. You can create those additional examples by running the existing model over data and extracting the entity spans you care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then mix those examples in with your existing data and update the model with annotations of all labels.\n",
    "\n",

    "    \n",
    "**Problem 2: Models can't learb everything**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common problem is that your model just won't learn what you want it to.\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy's models make predictions based on the local context – for example, for named entities, the surrounding words are most important.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the decision is difficult to make based on the context, the model can struggle to learn it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The label scheme also needs to be consistent and not too specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, it may be very difficult to teach a model to predict whether something is adult clothing or children's clothing based on the context. However, just predicting the label \"clothing\" may work better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution 2 - Plan your label scheme carefully**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start training and updating models, it's worth taking a step back and planning your label scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to pick categories that are reflected in the local context and make them more generic if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can always add a rule-based system later to go from generic to specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generic categories like \"clothing\" or \"band\" are both easier to label and easier to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "    LABELS = ['ADULT_SHOES', 'CHILDRENS_SHOES', 'BANDS_I_LIKE'] **BAD**\n",

    "In the first chapter, you learned how to extract linguistic features like part-of-speech tags, syntactic dependencies and named entities, and how to work with pre-trained statistical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also learned to write powerful match patterns to extract words and phrases using spaCy's matcher and phrase matcher.\n",

    "Chapter 2 was all about information extraction, and you learned how to work with the data structures, the Doc, Token and Span, as well as the vocab and lexical entries.\n",

    "You also used spaCy to predict semantic similarities using word vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In chapter 3, you got some more insights into spaCy's pipeline, and learned to write your own custom pipeline components that modify the Doc.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also created your own custom extension attributes for Docs, Tokens and Spans, and learned about processing streams and making your pipeline faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in chapter 4, you learned about training and updating spaCy's statistical models, specifically the entity recognizer.\n",
